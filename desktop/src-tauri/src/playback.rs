//! Engine-owned audio playback.
//!
//! This replaces the webview audio preview (see the superseded
//! docs/decisions/0004): the engine decodes, mixes and clocks all audible
//! clips itself, and the UI is a controller that follows.
//!
//! The shape of it:
//!
//! - Every audible clip's span is decoded **once** by FFmpeg straight to raw
//!   PCM - the clip's filter chain and speed baked in with the same filters
//!   the exporter uses, so the preview and the export cannot disagree. The
//!   PCM lands as a file in the project's cache and is memory-mapped, so
//!   memory stays bounded however long the material is, and a reopened
//!   project pays nothing.
//!
//! - One cpal output stream mixes the mapped clips sample by sample, with
//!   volume and fades applied at mix time. Gain-only edits therefore never
//!   re-decode, and what a fade sounds like has exactly one definition: this
//!   file's `gain_at`.
//!
//! - The playback clock is the audio device's own sample counter. The UI
//!   receives `transport` position events and interpolates between them;
//!   there is no second clock to drift against.
//!
//! - The stream is *supervised*: pulled headphones, a changed default
//!   device, or a device that was missing at launch all rebuild the stream
//!   rather than leaving the session silent until restart. The supervisor
//!   re-seeds the new stream from the shared clock and the last clip set,
//!   so a rebuild sounds like a hiccup, not a reset.
//!
//! The mix callback owns its state and receives changes as messages; the
//! only lock it touches is an uncontended try-lock on the message channel
//! (contended solely during a rebuild, when the callback is being replaced
//! anyway). Decodes run on a small worker pool, newest request first - a
//! scrubbed trim queues many spans and the one under the playhead matters
//! most - and the clip set is re-sent to the callback as each one lands.
//!
//! Both caches are bounded. In memory, mappings not referenced by the
//! current clip set are dropped beyond a cap, oldest use first. On disk,
//! `cache/audio` keeps a byte budget: least-recently-modified files beyond
//! it are removed, never one the current clip set is using.
